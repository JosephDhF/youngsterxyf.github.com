Fabric is a Python (2.5 or higher) library and command-line tool for
streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration
tasks. It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote
shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well
as auxiliary functionality such prompting the running user for input, or
aborting execution.
